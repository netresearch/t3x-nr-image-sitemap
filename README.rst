nr_image_sitemap
================
This extension provides a data provider to use with the typo3/cms-seo extension, to create an image sitemap.

Instalation
-----------
1. Install the extension via composer
.. code-block:: bash

    composer require netresearch/nr-image-sitemap

Configuration
=============

Before using the extension, ensure that the start page with the lowest ID is configured as the root page. This ID serves as the starting point for the sitemap generation.

**Configuration via Backend Constants Editor**

1. Navigate to the **Template** module in the TYPO3 backend.
2. Select the topmost page in your site tree (this should be the root page).
3. Switch on **Constant Editor**.
4. In the Constant Editor, choose the correct extension context, which in this case is for `PLUGIN.TX_NRIMAGESITEMAP`.
5. Locate the field labeled **The Root page ID**.
6. Enter the value `1` (or the ID of your root page).

This ensures that the extension knows the correct starting point for generating the sitemap.

Generating the Image Sitemap
=============================

The extension introduces a new page type ``1642072014`` specifically for generating an image sitemap.

To view the generated sitemap, open:

.. code-block:: plaintext

    https://<YOUR-DOMAIN>/?type=1642072014

Integrating with CMS-SEO Sitemap
================================

If you want to integrate the image sitemap into the sitemap generated by the CMS-SEO extension, use the following URL:

.. code-block:: plaintext

    https://<YOUR-DOMAIN>/?type=1533906435

This will embed the image sitemap within the main sitemap provided by the CMS-SEO extension.
